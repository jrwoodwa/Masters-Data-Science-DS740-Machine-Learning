Imagine feeling refreshed every morning: awakening energized, mentally resilient, and physically revitalized. This machine learning analysis (e.g., Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting) of my two-year biometric data delves into what distinguishes great, OK, and poor sleep, which may guide more informed lifestyle improvements.

Moreover, this exploration is a gold mine for Garmin, offering valuable insights into sleep. For example, imagine: what if a successful `SleepQuality` classification existed? What if Garmin added it as an automatic `SleepQuality` metric to their software? Wouldn't Garmin boost the value of its sleep tracking device and improve users' health and happiness? It would be a chance for Garmin to gain a decisive competitive edge in the sleep-tracking market.
