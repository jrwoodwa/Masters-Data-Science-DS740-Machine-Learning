Imagine feeling refreshed every morningâ€”awakening energized, mentally resilient, and physically revitalized each morning. This machine learning analysis (e.g., Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting) of my two-year biometric data delves into what distinguishes great, OK, and poor sleep, which may guide more informed lifestyle improvements.

Moreover, this exploration is a gold mine for Garmin, offering valuable insights into sleep. For example, imagine: what if there was a successful `SleepQuality` classification? What if Garmin added it to their software as an automatic `SleepQuality` metric? Wouldn't Garmin boost their sleep tracking device's value and improve users' health and happiness? It would be a chance for Garmin to gain a decisive competitive edge in the sleep-tracking market.
